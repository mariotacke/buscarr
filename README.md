## Usage

### Development
During development, the extension uses webpack dev server for hot module reloading. After starting the build, go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) and click "Load unpacked" to load the extension from the `build/` folder.

```
npm install
npm start
```

### Building
Building via `npm run build` creates a stand-alone artifact in the `build/` folder. This process also clears up any temporary files created during development, such as HMR deltas.

```
npm install
npm run build
```
